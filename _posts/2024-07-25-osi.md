## OSI 7 Layer Model

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application 

---
### Physical Layer

- Make sure 1's & 0's get between host
- Think Wires 
- Getting info from one system to another
- Ethernet Frame: Preamble and FCS are read at this layer to see where frame needs to go

---
### Data Link layer

- Allow individual systems to be addressed so ethernet frames go to the right spot
- Based on MAC Address
- Ethernet Frame: Check Destination (send too) and Source (send back) MAC Addresses
- Used for local area network
- NICs operate at this layer

---
### Network Layer

- For large distributed networks like the internet
- Uses IP addresses to find sources and destination
- Look at packets and check IP addresses 
- Ethernet Frame: Destination and Source IP addresses
- Routers operate at this level because they deal with IP addresses

---
### Transport Layer

- Assemble and Disassemble data
- Ethernet Frame: each ethernet frame can hold 1500 bytes of data maximum
- Ex. When sending a video the Transport layer will chop the frames up into 1500 byte chucks to send, if a video is coming in the transport layer will assemble the frames into the video.

---
### Session Layer

- Makes the connection to the remote host (ex web server, email client, etc)
- Once connection is established, data can flow between the two connections 
- Ports in the session layer get the data to the right application
- Ethernet Frame: Destination and Source Ports

---
### Presentation Layer

- Makes sure data gets to the application in a format that the application can view it
- Not that important anymore
- Ethernet Frame: Data

---
### Application Layer

- Applications that read the data 
- Ethernet Frame: Data

---
### Frames

- Devices on a network send and receive data in discrete chunks called frames or (packets)
- Frames are a maximum of 1500 bytes 
- Frames are created and destroyed inside the network interface card (NIC)

---
### MAC Addresses

- Unique 48-bit identifier for a NIC
- Frames have destination and source MAC addresses
- NICs use MAC addresses to decide whether or not to process a frame

---
### Broadcast vs Unicast

- A unicast transmission is addresses to a single device on a network
- A broadcast transmission is sent to every device in a broadcast domain
- A broadcast address looks like this: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF (12 F's)

---
### IP Addressing

- An IPv4 address looks like this: 31.44.17.231
- A router connects multiple local area networks (LANs)
- The IP packet within the frame never changes

---
### Packets & Ports

- Port numbers help direct packet traffic between the source and destination
- Packets have sequence numbers so the network software can reassemble the file correctly
- TCP is connection-oriented, UDP is connectionless
