#### SOC
- Security Operations Centers 
- A centralized team and facility responsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents within an organization.

#### SOC Primary Functions
- Incident Response (NIST 800-61)
1. Preparation
2. Detection and Analysis
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4. Post-Incident Activity
5. Preparation (loop)

#### Vulnerability Management
1. Discover Vulnerabilities on Systems 
2. Prioritize Systems
3. Assess (baed on asset criticality, vulnerability threat, and asset classification)
4. Report (measure risk)
5. Remediate (fix/patch/remove/etc.)
6. Verify Remediation (make sure the fix you performed worked)
7. Discover (loop)

#### Common SOC Tools
- SIEM - Security Information and Event Management (Azure Sentinel)
- Threat Intelligence platform (Azure Sentinel: Threat Intelligence Data Connectors)
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Network traffic analysis tools (Network Security Group Flow Logs with Azure)
- Vulnerability scanners (Microsoft Defender for Cloud: Vulnerability Management)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) tools (Azure IAM)
- Incident Response Platforms (NIST 800-61 and some capabilities within Sentinel and Azure)

##### SOC Roles
- SOC Analyst
- Incident Responder 
- Threat Intelligence 
- SOC Manager
- Security Engineer 
- Compliance Analyst 
- Forensic Analyst

#### SIEM
- Security Information and Event Management
- Solution that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats
- Combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) into one security management system. SIEMs collect event log data from a range of sources, identifies activity that deviates from the norm with real-time analysis, and takes appropriate action.

#### SIEM Components
- Data Collection
- Log Management
- Correlation Engine
- Alerting and Notification
- Reporting and Dashboards 
- Incident Management
- Integration with other security tools and services

#### SIEM Correlation Engine
 - The correlation engine finds relationship between different logs

#### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Signs of a security breach
- Logs can show IOCs
